# :simple-pytest: PyTests

## :octicons-file-directory-16: Directory
The `tests` folder should mirror `src` to ensure that each submodule is properly tested.  Include an `integration` folder under `tests` to evaluate larger tests.

```
project
└───src
|   └─── __init__.py
│   └─── ModuleA
│       └─── __init__.py
│       └─── A.py
└───tests
    └─── __init__.py
    └─── ModuleA
         └─── __init__.py
         └─── A_test.py
```

!!! warning
    It is generally recommended that you do not have `tests` in your `src` folder since they would become importable as part of your distribution.

!!! tip
    Tests should include both `unit` and `integration` testing.

```bash
pytest # run all tests
```

```bash
pytest pytest tests/basic_test.py # run tests in module
```

```bash
pytest tests/basic_test.py::test_hello_world # run a specific test
```

!!! info
    PyTest provides additional features such as [parameter sweeping](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/example/parametrize.html), [fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/explanation/fixtures.html?highlight=fixtures), and [logging](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/logging.html?highlight=fixtures).  These should be applied depending on the test requirements.

## :octicons-checklist-16: Coverage
PyTests offers `coverage` support.  When running PyTests with Coverage, it will generate a HTML that show which parts of your repo have not been traced using PyTests.  This lets you know which areas of your code still need to be tested.

```bash
pytest --cov=./ --cov-report=html:<OUTPUT_PATH>
```

## :material-view-dashboard: Allure
[Allure](https://allurereport.org/) provides a dashboard that aggregates your pytest results.  Allure provides additional functionality like tagging for your tests to organize them into a tree structure.  In order to use allure, you must install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install allure
```

To create and view an Allure report:

```bash
pytest --alluredir ./  # run pytests
```

```bash
allure generate --single-file --output ./ # generate a report (HTML)
```
